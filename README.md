# Dynamic Programming Examples

This repository contains several examples of dynamic programming, implemented using different techniques such as tabulation, memoization, and recursion. The purpose of these examples is to provide a clear understanding of how these methods work and when to use each one.

## Contents

- **Tabulation Method**: This method involves solving problems iteratively and storing the results in a table (array) to avoid recomputation.
- **Memoization Method**: This method is a top-down approach where the results of subproblems are stored in a cache (typically a dictionary) to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Recursion Method**: This approach solves problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each recursively.

## Usage

Each file in this repository is a standalone example of a specific dynamic programming problem, solved using one of the methods mentioned above. You can run these scripts individually to see how each method approaches the problem.



## How to Run

1. Clone this repository,Navigate to the directory and Run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-programming-examples.git

   cd Problem_Solving
   
   python filename.py
